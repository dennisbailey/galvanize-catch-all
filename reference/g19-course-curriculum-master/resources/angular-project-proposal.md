# Angular Project Proposal

## Objective

**It's time to put everything that you've learned thus far to the test!**

Create a proposal for an independent (or pair) project that you will implement over 4 days. The purpose of this proposal is simple - formulate your idea and articulate the requirements of your application.

You must obtain approval from an instructor based on your proposal before you can start the project. The purpose of this is to help identify and address areas/requirements that are underdeveloped as well as areas that are beyond the scope of a 4-day project. Think of this proposal as a high-level overview of your project.

Typically, projects fit under these categories:

1. A minimum viable product (MVP). Think about who this product is for and the problem that your product attempts to solve.
1. A technology experiment meant to demonstrate your mastery in a single or combination of technologies. For example, if you have an idea for using CSS3 transitions or canvas to show off something, well, cool, think about what features you'd like to demonstrate.

> This is a great opportunity to build something for your portfolio to show potential employers!

## Deliverable

For this assignment, create a single markdown document that includes:

1. A project description, detailing the purpose of your app
1. A list of technologies that you plan to use
1. A well-defined and written-out feature list

*Be ready to discuss this proposal with an instructor.*

## Project Requirements

### Technologies

- MEAN Stack
  - NodeJS
  - ExpressJS back-end - utilize mostly RESTful routes that serve JSON
  - Angular front-end
  - MongoDB (along with Mongoose or Monk)
- Gulp
- PassportJS for Authentication
- Bootstrap (or an alternative front-end framework)

### External Data Source

You must use an external data source to add functionality to your app. How you obtain the data is up to you - web scraping, external API, your own data.

### Interactivity

You must utilize DOM manipulation, adding/removing elements, event handlers, and/or animation via Angular.

### Separation of Concerns

Your Angular Controllers should be thin when it comes to logic. You should move anything that doesn’t relate *directly* to manipulating the view model to a factory/service.

### Code Quality

- Your code must be commented and contain proper indentation. *We (the instructors) reserve the right to refuse reviewing your code if you do not follow these basic requirements.*

### TDD (bonus!)

Take a TDD approach!

## Examples

- Search Instagram posts by hashtags (i.e., `#levelup`)
- Sentiment Analysis on Git Commits
- Utilize Google Maps and Facebook/Twitter/Soundcloud API’s to visualize where your followers are from
- Ping-pong scheduling/scoring system
- Study study tracker to organize study time, notes, questions, and Github commits, all in one place
- Idea generator for web applications where you select the number of external APIs you would like to use and then you will be presented with randomly generated ideas
- Multi user DJ application, where people can connect to and and add music as a group
