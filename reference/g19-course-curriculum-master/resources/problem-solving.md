# Problem Solving 101

1. Define problem
1. Break the problem down into smaller, bite-size pieces
1. Pseudocode each step (whiteboard it out, draw pictures, whatever!)
1. Turn pseudocode into code comments
1. Code iteratively (code, test, code, test...)

**WHY THIS PROCESS?**

1. Programming is about problem solving, NOT syntax.

  ```sh
  function addValueToAnArray(language) {
    return "Hey Google, how do I insert elements into an array in "+language
  }
  addValueToAnArray("python")
  addValueToAnArray("javascript")
  addValueToAnArray("java")
  addValueToAnArray("ruby")
  ```

1. Most problems are TOO large to fully encompass in your head.
1. It's easy to use. It hones your logical abilities. It works for me. If it doesn't work for you, find a different process - there's plenty out there. But give this process a try.
