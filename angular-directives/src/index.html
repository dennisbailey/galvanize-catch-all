          <p>The unexpected is our normal routine. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? You enjoyed that. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf.</p>
